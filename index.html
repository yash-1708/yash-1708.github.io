            Hello! My name is Yash Bhandare, and I am a skilled and accomplished
            computer science professional. Currently pursuing my masterâ€™s degree
            in computer science from Purdue University, I have a Bachelor's
            degree from Pune University, I bring a strong academic foundation to
            my work. My technical skills encompass a wide range of programming
            languages, including TypeScript, JavaScript, C#, Python, GO and
            more, along with expertise in tools like AWS, Docker, Git, and the
            likes.
          </p>
          <span class="image left"><img src="images/dp.jpg" alt="" /></span>
          <p>
            During my 2+ year tenure at Avalara, I thrived as a Software
            Developer, contributing to the development of numerous REST APIs in
            the Express.js framework. I played a key role in migrating legacy
            JavaScript code to TypeScript and successfully designed and
            maintained multiple production level SQL databases. Additionally, I
            led the Shared Services team as a Scrum Master, ensuring smooth
            project execution, and took charge as a security champion for 2
            quarters. My experience includes deploying compliant infrastructure
            with terraform in AWS and managing APIs, salesforce records, and
            monitoring systems for thousands of customers.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a Software Development Intern at Fairlinx, I gained valuable
            experience in developing coding automation tools and enhancing UI
            functionalities. Furthermore, my role as a Data Science Intern at
            Metalbrain Technologies allowed me to employ my analytical skills in
            creating a novel approach for rating stock market analysts using a
            Naive Bayes Classifier, resulting in a research paper presented at
            the IEEE INCET 2020 conference amongst researchers from around the
            globe.
          </p>
          <p>
            My affinity for research has led me to be involved in the authorship
            of another research paper currently in the process of being
            published. My current research uses Genetic Algorithms and Simulated
            Annealing to solve a significant problem in the Machine Learning
            Domain, so keep an eye out for that publication!
          </p>
          <p>
            Beyond my technical expertise, I possess strong leadership
            abilities, agile methodologies, and effective communication skills.
            I am certified as an AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner and a
            Certified Scrum Lead. I am also a MENSA Lifetime Member and have
            pursued other certifications in Python, NodeJS, Data Governance, Go
            Language to name a few.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to my professional pursuits, I have actively contributed
            to social causes, serving as the Secretary of the Toastmasters Club
            of Pune and volunteering as a mentor and tutor at Responsible
            Charity. These experiences have strengthened my leadership skills,
            social responsibility, and commitment to making a positive impact in
            the community.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am now eager to explore new opportunities where I can leverage my
            diverse skill set and passion for innovation. If you are seeking a
            dedicated and accomplished computer science professional with a
            strong track record of success, I would eagerly welcome the
            opportunity to connect and discuss how I can contribute to your

            My coding philosophy is that rather than spending a lot of time on a
            lot of code, I'd spend a lot of time on finding a way to do the same
            task using as efficient and as little code as possible. Here are
            some of my projects:
          </p>

              </li>
              <li>This is my undergraduate capstone project.</li>
              <li>
                My team and I used a novel approach to create an end-to-end
                system to give Stock Market Analysts an unbiased rating based
                solely on their historical performance.
              </li>
              <li>
                Our original research was published in the IEEE INCET 2020
                conference.
              </li>
              <li>
                For this project, we started by creating a custom data scraping
                script in Selenium, which helped us gather 20000+ stock purchase
                recommendations given by 500+ stock market analysts.
              </li>
              <li>
                These recommendations covered a span of 3 years and after
                putting this data through a rigorous data cleaning and
                conditioning layer of code, it was stored in a MySQL database.
              </li>
              <li>
                A Naive Bayes Classifier along with some business logic was used
                to extract meaningful ratings that were conditioned using a
                K-Means algorithm layer to finally get a rating out of 5 stars
                for each Analyst.
              </li>
              <li>
                The System was coded in Python 3 with a flask REST API that was
                served using a simple React.Js webpage.

                This project was the result of a semester long independent
                research study under Prof.Mohammedreza Hajiarbabi during my
                Masters studies at Purdue University.
              </li>
              <li>
                I developed two novel approaches to solve the problem of
                searching through the vast search space of possible
                hyperparameter for any given instance of using a Machine
                Learning Model.
              </li>
              <li>
                One of the approaches was based on the Genetic Algorithm and the
                other based on Simulated Annealing.
              </li>
              <li>
                The Genetic Algorithm is a Metaheuristic Algorithm that will
                create 'populations' of possible solutions to a problem and
                proceed to search through them
              </li>

                This was the course project I developed as a part of my team for the Applications of Deep Learning course in my first semester as a masters student at Purdue University. This project went on to win the best course project award under the invaluable tutoring of Dr.Zesheng Chen
              </li>
              <li>
                After analyzing a multitude of options, we decided on using WhisperAI's NLP model to develop a system to tranlate, transcribe and subtitle audio and video files.
              </li>  
              <li>
                The most crucial part of the project was the creation of the translation interface that would translate audio in real time. We achieved this using a streaming socket.
              </li>
              <li>The other functionalities included transcription and auto-subtitling videos in English from many other languages supported by the WhisperAi model</li>

          <p>
            On a personal note, let me provide you with a glimpse into my life
            beyond my professional endeavors. I believe in maintaining a healthy
            work-life balance and pursuing various interests that enrich my
            overall well-being. Outside of the professional sphere, I am an avid
            learner, always seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge and
            skill set. Whether it's delving into the latest advancements in
            technology, exploring new hobbies, or engaging in thought-provoking
            discussions, I strive to embrace continuous growth and personal

          <p>
            In my free time, I enjoy staying physically active. Engaging in
            activities such as hiking, cycling, and yoga not only keep me fit
            but also help me clear my mind and rejuvenate. The outdoors provide
            me with a sense of serenity and appreciation for the beauty of
            nature.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moreover, I am a firm believer in giving back to society.
            Volunteering with organizations that support underprivileged
            communities has been a fulfilling and humbling experience for me. It
            allows me to contribute positively to society and make a meaningful
            difference in the lives of others.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lastly, I value quality time spent with family and friends. Building
            and nurturing strong relationships is important to me, as it brings
            joy, support, and a sense of belonging. Whether it's engaging in
            stimulating conversations, celebrating milestones, or embarking on
            adventures together, I cherish the moments shared with loved ones.
          </p>
          <p>
            In summary, my personal life is characterized by a thirst for
            knowledge, a love for literature, an active and healthy lifestyle, a
            commitment to social responsibility, and strong connections with
            family and friends. These aspects of my life not only contribute to
            my personal growth and happiness but also enhance my professional
            endeavors by fostering creativity, resilience, and a well-rounded
            perspective.
