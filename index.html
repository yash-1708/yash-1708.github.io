          Hello! My name is Yash Bhandare, and I am a skilled and accomplished
          computer science professional. I graduated with my master’s degree
          in computer science from Purdue University, I have a Bachelor's
          degree from The University of Pune, I bring a strong academic foundation to
          my work. My technical skills encompass a wide range of programming
          languages, including TypeScript, JavaScript, C#, Python, GO and
          more, along with expertise in tools like AWS, Docker, Git, and the
          likes.
        </p>
        <span class="image left"><img src="images/dp.jpg" alt="" /></span>
        <p>
          During my 2+ year tenure at <a href="https://www.avalara.com/us/en/index.html">Avalara</a>, I thrived as a
          Software
          Developer, contributing to the development of numerous REST APIs in
          the Express.js framework. I played a key role in migrating legacy
          JavaScript code to TypeScript and successfully designed and
          maintained multiple production level SQL databases. Additionally, I
          led the Shared Services team as a Scrum Master, ensuring smooth
          project execution, and took charge as a security champion for 2
          quarters. My experience includes deploying compliant infrastructure
          with terraform in AWS and managing APIs, salesforce records, and
          monitoring systems for thousands of customers.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a Software Development Intern at <a href="https://www.fsmpro.io/">Fairlinx</a>, I gained valuable
          experience in developing coding automation tools and enhancing UI
          functionalities. Furthermore, my role as a Data Science Intern at
          Metalbrain Technologies allowed me to employ my analytical skills in
          creating a novel approach for rating stock market analysts using a
          Naive Bayes Classifier, resulting in a <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9154002">research
            paper</a> presented at
          the IEEE INCET 2020 conference amongst researchers from around the
          globe.
        </p>
        <p>
          My affinity for research has led me to be involved in the authorship
          of another research paper currently in the process of being
          published. My current research uses Genetic Algorithms and Simulated
          Annealing to solve a significant problem in the Machine Learning
          Domain, so keep an eye out for that publication!
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond my technical expertise, I possess strong leadership
          abilities, agile methodologies, and effective communication skills.
          I am certified as an AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner and a
          Certified Scrum Lead. I am also a MENSA Lifetime Member and have
          pursued other certifications in Python, NodeJS, Data Governance, Go
          Language to name a few.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to my professional pursuits, I have actively contributed
          to social causes, serving as the Secretary of the Toastmasters Club
          of Pune and volunteering as a mentor and tutor at Responsible
          Charity. These experiences have strengthened my leadership skills,
          social responsibility, and commitment to making a positive impact in
          the community.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am now eager to explore new opportunities where I can leverage my
          diverse skill set and passion for innovation. If you are seeking a
          dedicated and accomplished computer science professional with a
          strong track record of success, I would eagerly welcome the
          opportunity to connect and discuss how I can contribute to your
          organization's growth and success.

          My coding philosophy centers on efficiency and elegance.
          I believe in investing time to discover the most efficient way to accomplish a task,
           using the least amount of code possible, rather than spending excessive time on extensive coding.
          Here are
          some of my projects:

            </li>
            <li>This is my undergraduate capstone project.</li>
            <li>
              My team and I used a novel approach to create an end-to-end
              system to give Stock Market Analysts an unbiased rating based
              solely on their historical performance.
            </li>
            <li>
              Our original research was published in the IEEE INCET 2020
              conference.
            </li>
            <li>
              For this project, we started by creating a custom data scraping
              script in Selenium, which helped us gather 20000+ stock purchase
              recommendations given by 500+ stock market analysts.
            </li>
            <li>
              These recommendations covered a span of 3 years and after
              putting this data through a rigorous data cleaning and
              conditioning layer of code, it was stored in a MySQL database.
            </li>
            <li>
              A Naive Bayes Classifier along with some business logic was used
              to extract meaningful ratings that were conditioned using a
              K-Means algorithm layer to finally get a rating out of 5 stars
              for each Analyst.
            </li>
            <li>
              The System was coded in Python 3 with a flask REST API that was
              served using a simple React.Js webpage.

              This project was the result of a semester long independent
              research study under Prof.Mohammedreza Hajiarbabi during my
              Masters studies at Purdue University.
            </li>
            <li>
              I developed two novel approaches to solve the problem of
              searching through the vast search space of possible
              hyperparameter for any given instance of using a Machine
              Learning Model.
            </li>
            <li>
              One of the approaches was based on the Genetic Algorithm and the
              other based on Simulated Annealing.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Genetic Algorithm is a Metaheuristic Algorithm that will
              create 'populations' of possible solutions to a problem and
              proceed to search through them
            </li>

              This was the course project I developed as a part of my team for the Applications of Deep Learning course
              in my first semester as a masters student at Purdue University. This project went on to win the best
              course project award under the invaluable tutoring of Dr.Zesheng Chen
            </li>
            <li>
              After analyzing a multitude of options, we decided on using WhisperAI's NLP model to develop a system to
              tranlate, transcribe and subtitle audio and video files.
            </li>
            <li>
              The most crucial part of the project was the creation of the translation interface that would translate
              audio in real time. We achieved this using a streaming socket.
            </li>
            <li>The other functionalities included transcription and auto-subtitling videos in English from many other
              languages supported by the WhisperAi model</li>

        <p>
          On a personal note, let me provide you with a glimpse into my life
          beyond my professional endeavors. I believe in maintaining a healthy
          work-life balance and pursuing various interests that enrich my
          overall well-being. Outside of the professional sphere, I am an avid
          learner, always seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge and
          skill set. Whether it's delving into the latest advancements in
          technology, exploring new hobbies, or engaging in thought-provoking
          discussions, I strive to embrace continuous growth and personal
          development.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond my passion for computer science, I find solace in exploring
          the world of literature. Reading allows me to broaden my horizons,
          ignite my imagination, and gain valuable insights into diverse
          perspectives. I am particularly fond of fiction, science fiction,
          and self-improvement literature, which not only entertain me but
          also inspire me to think critically and explore new ideas.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my free time, I enjoy staying physically active. Engaging in
          activities such as hiking, cycling, and yoga not only keep me fit
          but also help me clear my mind and rejuvenate. The outdoors provide
          me with a sense of serenity and appreciation for the beauty of
          nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, I am a firm believer in giving back to society.
          Volunteering with organizations that support underprivileged
          communities has been a fulfilling and humbling experience for me. It
          allows me to contribute positively to society and make a meaningful
          difference in the lives of others.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, I value quality time spent with family and friends. Building
          and nurturing strong relationships is important to me, as it brings
          joy, support, and a sense of belonging. Whether it's engaging in
          stimulating conversations, celebrating milestones, or embarking on
          adventures together, I cherish the moments shared with loved ones.
        </p>
        <p>
          In summary, my personal life is characterized by a thirst for
          knowledge, a love for literature, an active and healthy lifestyle, a
          commitment to social responsibility, and strong connections with
          family and friends. These aspects of my life not only contribute to
          my personal growth and happiness but also enhance my professional
          endeavors by fostering creativity, resilience, and a well-rounded
          perspective.
